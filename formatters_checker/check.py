word="We recommend the use of the @stable tag, but per version tags also
exist if you prefer that. Note that the actionâ€™s version you select 
is independent of the version of Black the action will use."

new= "The version of Black the action will use can be configured via version. 
This can be any valid version specifier or just the version number if you want an exact version.
The action defaults to the latest release available on PyPI. 
Only versions available from PyPI are supported, so no commit SHAs or branch names."
